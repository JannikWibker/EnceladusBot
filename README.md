# EnceladusBot

[EnceladusBot](https://telegram.me/enceladusbot) is my personal little Telegram Bot. It does not have that many features yet but it can do some kinda cool things

A list of commands and features can be found [here](https://bot.jannik.ml) and also inside Telegram from the bot itself. 

Once connected to Spotify the bot can control basic Spotify playback (if you have Spotify premium, else the api does not work) and show the currently playing song aswell.
